Hello, I'm Anthony. I am a teacher in the Eastern US. I have a BA in Philosophy and a Master's in Theology (Go Duke), now turning my attention to learning web development to better support my family. I began The Odin Project around Christmas '21, and my goal is to continue working as a secondary school teacher while studying and practicing.
