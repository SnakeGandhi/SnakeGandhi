Hello, I'm Anthony. I am a secondary school teacher in the Eastern US. I have a BA in Philosophy and a Master's in Theology (Go Duke). I'm now turning my attention to learning web development because I want to have a freelance source of income, contribute to Open Source projects, and challenge myself to learn a new skill. 
To that end, I began The Odin Project around Christmas '21, and my goal is to keep teaching while studying and practicing. I hope you find some projects on my GitHub that you find interesting!
