Hello, I'm Anthony. I am a secondary school teacher in the Eastern US. I have a BA in Philosophy and a Master's in Theology (Go Duke), now turning my attention to learning web development to challenge myself and to one day be able to freelance. I began The Odin Project around Christmas '21, and my goal is to keep teaching while studying and practicing.
